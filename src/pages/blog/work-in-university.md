I joined the *PROJECT* team, where the team got a client and develop software for the client just like a software consultant. My first real project is to build an application for a garment (clothing) company to manage their inventories, orders, etc. The project was written in PHP, with CodeIgniter.

After a year, we're supposed to advanced to level 2. Level 1 was supposed to be a learner, intended for students who haven't had any experience in programming. Level 2 was supposed to be the senior, when a level 1 student started to show his/her skills, and could work with much less supervision. While level 3 feels like a project manager. At least that's how it was in team *Project*.

However, in that year, due to changes in the IT Directorate, we were instead offered a full-time job as a junior programmer instead.
