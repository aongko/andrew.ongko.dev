## Programming Language

I love **Python** for general purposes.
But definitely using it for data science and scripting purposes.

**Golang** is my preference when it comes to most backend APIs.

I also uses **Typescript** for full-stack work.

## Full Stack

For full-stack applications, my go-to stack would be [t3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/).

## Text Editor

I use VSCode.
