My career started since the first year of college. I went to Bina Nusantara (Binus) University. In my first semester, there's an opening of a program called **Associate Member**. The program allow students to be working just like how a part timer would, a 20-hour/week job, developing software for the Binus group.

I joined the *PROJECT* team, where the team got a client and develop software for the client just like a software consultant. My first real project is to build an application for a garment (clothing) company to manage their inventories, orders, etc. The project was written in PHP, with CodeIgniter.
