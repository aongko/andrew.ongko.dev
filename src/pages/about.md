I started my career in early 2012 writing PHP using CodeIgniter.
Fast-forward to 2015, when I was in the last semester of college, I started to take an interest in machine learning. Then I joined Kurio as a software engineer, doing machine learning.

Kurio is a content aggregator app. With an investment from a Japanese company, me and a few engineers were sent to their HQ in Japan to learn a thing or two regarding the tech they used for their content aggregator app. We tried to fulfill our tagline, a "smart news app".

Me and my team build a platform that allows us to do offline tests and A/B tests for our newsfeed algorithm. We also build the whole pipeline to do content classification, topic modeling, clustering, etc.

My team also contributed to [Spacy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) in the Bahasa Indonesia language. We also built a Named-Entity Recognition (NER) which we used in a separate product, a media monitoring tools, where a user might want to "follow" certain "entity", such as person, and organization.

From there, my role in the company widens from managing a team of Data Science Engineers, to manage a whole engineering team for a product. It includes backend, web, and mobile engineers, on top of the data science engineers.

To further make an impact, I proposed several process improvement regarding product development. One of the notable process that we introduced to the team were OKRs (Objective and Key Results), and BSC (Balanced Score Card).

OKRs were to help the team members engaged and facilitate passionate engineers that might have many ideas to improve the product.
BSC were introduced to improve our performance appraisal system from a subjective review to a more objective review.
